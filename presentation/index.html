								<p>The systemâ€™s purpose is to provide a database for users to record any symptoms they might be feeling related to the Covid-19 in a work environment. This is to try and keep people in a work environment safe, so that employees or employers at a job can be catalogued with any symptoms they might have and can be accessed by anyone so that they are aware who is sick, may be sick, or is perfectly healthy and take the proper precautions. Employees have multiple properties of information such as name, id, and email that can be accessed and edit.</p>
